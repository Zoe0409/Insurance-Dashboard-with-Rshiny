# Basic Insurer Dashboard

Basic Shiny application looking at an insurer's claims.  The inputs allow for data transformations similar to what you might do in an Excel claims analysis (e.g. one table looks at claim changes from one time period to another).  Outputs are displayed in nice charts (using the [highcharter](http://jkunst.com/highcharter/DT) package) and tables (using the [DT](package) package)

The 'download report' Function is in development.
